### Challenges?
At a glance, it looked quite achievable over a short period of time, the only challenge i found was the organisation of data
provided. I designed a data.json file, that includes (to the best of my ability) the dummy data, organised in way that was intended to 
support the layout and styling of the notifications. Aside from that, it was smooth.
